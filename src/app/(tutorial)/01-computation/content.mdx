# Everything Is Numbers

AI can write poetry, recognize faces, generate art, and hold conversations. It's not magic — it's math. But what kind of math? This chapter will show you the shape of the problem.

## A Machine That Can Think

A machine that writes poetry. A machine that looks at a photo and says "that's a golden retriever." A machine that translates between languages it was never explicitly taught. A machine that draws pictures from a sentence.

These things exist right now. They work. And they're all doing fundamentally the same thing.

They're not following hand-written rules. They're not looking things up in a giant database. They're computing — turning numbers in, getting numbers out — using a mathematical function that they *learned*.

But before we can understand how they learn, we need to understand the raw materials. And the first surprise is: **everything a computer works with is just numbers.**

## Everything Is Numbers

You might think of a text message as letters, a photo as colors, a song as sound. But inside a computer, all of them are the same thing: **arrays of numbers**.

**Text** is numbers. Every character has a number assigned to it (that's what Unicode is). The letter "H" is 72. The letter "e" is 101. Your text message is a sequence of numbers.

**Images** are numbers. Every pixel is described by three numbers — how much Red, Green, and Blue light to mix. A photo is just a giant grid of these number-triplets.

**Colors** are numbers. Every color you've ever seen can be described by just three numbers. Adjust those three numbers, and you get a completely different color.

**Sound** is numbers. A microphone samples the air pressure thousands of times per second. Each sample is a number. A three-minute song is about 8 million numbers.

Try it yourself:

<NumbersEverywhereWidget />

<TryIt>
In the Text tab, type your name and watch each letter turn into a number. In the Color tab, try to make your favorite color using just three sliders. In the Image tab, paint something and notice: the computer only sees numbers.
</TryIt>

<KeyInsight>
**Everything a computer works with — text, images, colors, sound, video — is just arrays of numbers.** This means every kind of "thinking" a computer does is really just *turning one array of numbers into another*.
</KeyInsight>

## Thinking Is a Function

Once you see that everything is numbers, something clicks: every kind of "intelligent" behavior is really just a **function** — something that takes numbers in and puts numbers out.

- **"Is this a cat?"** = a function that takes pixel values and outputs a confidence score
- **"Translate to French"** = a function that takes English character codes and outputs French character codes
- **"Write a poem about rain"** = a function that takes prompt characters and outputs poem characters
- **"Generate an image of a sunset"** = a function that takes text and outputs pixel values

Every single one of these is the same shape: **numbers in, numbers out**.

<FunctionMachineWidget />

<TryIt>
Click through the different tasks. Notice that despite doing wildly different things — recognizing images, translating text, answering questions, generating art — they all have the same shape: an array of numbers goes in, an array of numbers comes out. The only difference is what the function *does*.
</TryIt>

So all of AI reduces to one problem: **find the right function**.

If we could find the function that maps photo-pixels to the word "cat," we'd have image recognition. If we could find the function that maps English to French, we'd have translation. If we could find the function that maps prompts to good answers, we'd have a chatbot.

But how do you "find" a function?

## Machines with Knobs

Here's the idea: you build a **model** — a machine with adjustable knobs (called **parameters**). Different knob settings make the machine compute different functions. The challenge is finding the right settings.

Let's make this concrete. Below is a model with just 4 parameters (a, b, c, d) that computes:

**y = a + b·x + c·x² + d·x³**

There's a target curve (the blue one) — that's the function we *want*. Your job: adjust the four knobs to make the red curve match the blue one.

<ParameterPlaygroundWidget />

<TryIt>
Try to match the target curve by adjusting the sliders. Pay attention to how each parameter affects the shape. Then hit "Reveal best fit" to see the answer. Notice: even with just 4 parameters, it's surprisingly hard to find the right values by hand.
</TryIt>

<KeyInsight>
**A model is a machine with adjustable knobs.** Different knob settings compute different functions. Finding the right function means finding the right knob settings. With just 4 knobs, hand-tuning is already frustrating. Real AI models have *billions* of knobs. We're going to need a way to tune them automatically.
</KeyInsight>

## Can a Machine Compute Anything?

Before we go further, here's a question worth asking: are there limits to what functions a machine can compute?

In 1936, mathematicians Alan Turing and Alonzo Church independently proved something astonishing: there exist machines that can compute **any function that can be computed at all**. Not just arithmetic — *anything*. This is called the **Church-Turing thesis**.

This means that, in principle, if "thinking" is computation (turning numbers into numbers), then a computer can do anything a human mind can do. The question isn't *whether* the right function exists — it's whether we can *find* it.

## The Lazy Solution: A Giant Lookup Table

Here's a thought experiment. Forget about clever math. What if we just made a giant table? For every possible input, store the correct output.

Want image recognition? Make a table with one row for every possible image, and in each row, write what's in the image. Want translation? A row for every possible English sentence, paired with its French translation.

In theory, this works! Every function over finite inputs can be represented as a lookup table. Problem solved... right?

Let's see how big that table would need to be:

<LookupTableExplosionWidget />

<TryIt>
Start with a tiny image: just 4 pixels, black or white. That's only 16 entries — totally manageable. Now bump it up to 9 pixels. Then try 16 pixels with 256 shades of gray. Watch the number of entries explode past the number of atoms in the universe. And a real photo has *millions* of pixels.
</TryIt>

The lookup table approach fails spectacularly. Even for a tiny 10×10 grayscale image, the number of possible inputs is 256¹⁰⁰ — a number so large it makes the observable universe look small. You could never build a table that big. You could never even *count* that high.

## The Real Challenge

So here's where we are:

1. **Everything is numbers** — text, images, sound, all of it
2. **Thinking is a function** — every intelligent task is numbers-in, numbers-out
3. **Models are machines with knobs** — different settings compute different functions
4. **The right function exists** — the Church-Turing thesis guarantees it
5. **Brute force is impossible** — a lookup table would be bigger than the universe

We need models that **compress** — that capture the right pattern with far fewer parameters than a lookup table would need entries. And we need a way to **find** the right parameter values automatically, not by hand.

That process — automatically finding the right knob settings — is called **learning**. And that's what the rest of this tutorial is about.

In the next chapter, we'll meet the simplest possible computing unit: the **artificial neuron**. It combines a weighted sum with a threshold — one tiny decision-maker. We'll see what a single neuron can and can't do, and its limitations will motivate everything that comes after.
